# Polymer Character Card
###I love playing Betrayal at House on the Hill!
Then you know how irritating it is to manage the bulit in character cards.

###So what do I do?
Look for an app to manage it for you.  You find a few options, sure, but most are ugly and built on old frameworks.

###What's worse? 
Probaly not even open source.

###How am I supposed to play my custom characters if I can't edit the source?
Short answer: you can't.
Long answer: you ditch it and use &lt;character-card&gt; built with Polymer to extend your character list.

###But how do I add characters?
Easy. Fork it and add your custom character to the Characters array in characters.json. The application takes care of the rest.

###What if I don't have a color scheme in mind for my character?
Don't worry, leave that field blank. There's a default color scheme (plain black, how boring.)

###Can I at least see what it looks like before I decide?
Sure can, live demo right here on GitHub - custompro98.github.io/polymer-character-card

###I hate your interface/I want new characters/I want to practice working in Polymer
Fork it, download it, copy it, whatever. MIT license. I just ask you link back to my original source somehow. Put your own code under whatever license you feel is right.
